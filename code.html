                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <p> The code is structured in multiple <code>function()</code>s. I have detailed notes explaining what
                    each does and the code within, but I will also give a TLDR summary of what is going on.</p>
                <p>
                    First, mostly using HTML, I set up the app to look how I wanted, using two columns in a row for the
                    top half of the page, and a table for the lower half. I did make the logo on canva, as I have with
                    all of my logos so far.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are quite a few <code>function()</code>s that come into play to collect all the data and save
                    it in the
                    storage arrays, which uses local storage in your browser to build the table, as well as three
                    example
                    <code>array</code>s of information on three different cities so that you can kind of see how the
                    table looks before you put your own information in. The dropdown button at the top of the page will
                    allow you to either select to see all events and cities, or you can choose a specific city from the
                    dropdown to the see only event data from that specific city that you've selected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, we have five seperate <code>function()</code>s that either show the total, average, minimum,
                    or maximum attendees for the events, each named respectively in the code in their own seperate
                    <code>function()</code>s. You will see that those haven't been called into any other
                    <code>function()</code>s to be used, as the fifth, labelled
                    <code>function calculateStats(events)</code>, instead calculates all of the values. I left the other
                    ones in mostly as a reference so that I can go back and see how to do each individual calculation in
                    the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As extensive as this code seems, I feel like, more than the other challenges I've done, this really
                    tested my knowledge and ability to make sense of Javascript and apply it practically to a level I
                    hadn't faced before. Not to say that the other challenges weren't tough in their own rights, but now
                    I feel I have a more solid foundation on how to use <code>for()</code> loops and actually apply the
                    data and especially how to get information from the page, call it into a <code>function()</code> and
                    store the results in a local storage in the browser to view again later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you've made it this far, reviewing the code and reading my description of what's going on, maybe
                    reviewing some of my notes that I've commented out within the code itself, and you haven't tried the
                    app yet, head back to the App page and give it a try, see how it works. If you'd like to comment on
                    the App, or contact me for any further information, the <code>navlink</code> at the top of the page
                    labelled 'About' will take you to my portfolio, where you can contact me, or send me your
                    information and I can contact you.
                </p>
                <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
